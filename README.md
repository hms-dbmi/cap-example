# cap-example
An example of proposed CAP annotation view

- `datasets.xml` file contains description of the datasets being utilized, including custom names. This can be omitted if all the `<dataset>` entries rely on external dataset IDs
- Other xml files are using dataset names (or IDs), defining annotation mappings to the cells within these datasets
- model.md and model.png are not part of an example, but is a description of the proposed data model
