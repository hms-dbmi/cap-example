# cap-example
An example of proposed CAP annotation view

- `datasets.xml` file contains the description of the datasets being utilized, including custom names. This can be omitted if all the `<dataset>` entries rely on external dataset IDs
- Other xml files (`mouse_dataset_1.xml` and `human_dataset_2.xml`) are using dataset names (or IDs), defining annotation mappings to the cells within these datasets
- `model.md` and `model.png` are not part of the example, but is a description of the proposed data model
